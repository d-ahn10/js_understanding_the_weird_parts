Javascript: Understanding the Weird Parts
(Javascript under the hood)

Notes:

Conceptual Aside (Big Word Alert):
-Syntax Parser: A program that reads your code and determines what it does and if its grammar is valid.

-Execution Context: A wrapper to help manage the code that is running.
There are lots of lexical environments. Which one is currenlty running is managed via execution contexts. It can contain things beyond what you've written in your code.

-Lexical Environment: Where something sits physically in the code you write.
"Lexical" means "having to do with words or grammar". A lexical environment exists in programming languages in which where you write something is important.

-Name/value pair: A name which maps to a unique value.
The name may be defined more than once, but only can have one value in any given context. That value may be more name/value pairs.
Ex: 
Address: 
    {
        Street: 'Main',
        Number: 100,
        Apartment:
        {
            Floor: 3,
            Number: 301
        }
    }
